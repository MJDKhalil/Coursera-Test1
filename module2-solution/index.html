          <p id="p11">An authentic recipe for Moroccan Couscous with Seven Vegetables, the ultimate comfort food to enjoy with family and friends. Lamb, beef, or chicken is stewed with assorted veggies, then served atop a mound of light, fluffy steamed couscous. A rich broth seasoned with ginger, pepper and turmeric is poured over all or offered on the side. Couscous with Seven Vegetables is also referred to as Couscous Bidaoui, in reference to Casablanca.</p>

          <p id="p12">Slice 2 chicken breasts into strips or cubes. Brown the chicken in a pan and set aside. Chop 2 heads of broccoli, 2 zucchinis, 1 small piece of ginger and 1 garlic clove. Saute together with olive oil and teriyaki sauce. While cooking, make brown rice (1.5 cups uncooked â€“ follow box instructions). Once vegetables are cooked through, add chicken back into the pan and mix together (add more teriyaki if needed). The end result should be like a (much) healthier fried rice!</p>

          <p id="p13">Mix together store-bought pesto and dijon mustard (about 50/50) in a bowl and spread generously over salmon filets. Bake on 350 degrees for 15 minutes (a little more if you like it more well done). Serve it with a side of couscous (follow box directions) mixed with a little pesto and garlic powder, and arugula salad (1 box of arugula) with olive oil and the juice of 1 lemon. We have to credit our friend Katie Lee for telling us about this one!</p>
